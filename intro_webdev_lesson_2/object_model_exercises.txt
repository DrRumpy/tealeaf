1) A Ruby class is similar in structure as a method. However, it uses the reserved work "class" instead of "def".

	# example of class creation

	class Person

		def say
			puts "Hi!"
		end
	end

  fred = Person.new


2) A module is a package of behaviors/methods that can be imported into a class description. This gives objects instantiated
from the class access to methods defined in the module.

	# example of module creation

	module gesture
		def high_five
			puts "Give's you a high-five!"
		end
	end

  class Person

    include gesture

    def say
      puts "Hi!"
    end

  end

  fred = Person.new
  fred.say
  fred.high_five
