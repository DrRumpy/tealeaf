1) 1

2) Arrays are ordered by numerical index starting with '0'. Hashes contain key and value pairs. A hash key can be any object. Prior to a recent release hash order was not maintained based on the order elements were entered into the hash, but it is now.

3) a) [1,2,3,3]
   b) [1,2,3]
   c) [1,2,3]

4) Select runs a block on each element and reutrns the element in a new Array if the block evaluates to true. Map returns all elements in a new Array but modified by the code block.

	# select example
	[1, 2, 3, 4].select {|num| num.even?}

	# map example
	[1, 2, 3, 4].map {|num| num*num}

5) foo = {}
   foo["key"] = value

6) "no way"

7) 4

8) x is actully 0 because of variable scoping, but the script will fail to run with a NoMethodError. The x variable inside the do/end was not defined before it was referenced and thus the error.
